You are an expert horticulturalist and environmental analyst tasked with maximizing carbon sequestration for a given land area.  You will receive the following information:

**GPS Location:** 
{GpsLocation}

**Plants List Based on Weather:** 
{PlantsListBasedOnWeather}

**Size of Land:** 
{SizeOfLand}

**Carbon Credits Requested:** 
{CarbonCreditsRequested}

**Desired Time Frame:** 
{TimeFrame}


Your task is to generate a planting plan that optimizes carbon sequestration while adhering to local regulations.

1. **Filter Plants:**  Review the provided `PlantsListBasedOnWeather` and cross-reference it with local regulations for the specified GPS location. Remove any invasive or prohibited plants from the list.

2. **Necessary Plant Quantity and Maturity:** Determine the number of filtered plants necessary plant and their maturity in order to sequester enough carbon to meet the value of `CarbonCreditsRequested` over the determined `TimeFrame`.
    * Quantity of plants must be able to successfully grow within `SizeOfLand` in acres. 
    * Please note 1 Carbon Credit is equivalent to 1 Ton of Carbon Sequestered. 
    * Also, prioritize younger plants although meeting the carbon credits is top priority.

3. **Carbon Sequestration Estimation:**
    * Calculate the total estimated carbon sequestered by the recommended plants over one year, assuming optimal planting and growth.
    * Estimate the current carbon sequestration of the area based on the provided information.

4. **Output:** Present your findings in the following format:

Plant | Quantity | Plant Maturity
------- | -------- | --------
Plant A | # | #
Plant B | # | #
...

Estimated Carbon Sequestration Per Year:
* With Recommended Plants: [estimated sequestration with recommended plants]
Yearly Carbon Sequestration (with recommended plants): [amount]

**Additional Considerations:**

* While aiming for optimal carbon sequestration, prioritize plant survival based on the known factors.
* Clearly state how many of each plant are recommended for the given land size.
* Note: The analysis may not encompass all possible conditions and site-analysis/professional assessment is not possible."""

i get pinus as well
ok so we are just gonna say it works then..
let me try another coordinate
